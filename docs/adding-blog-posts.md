## Blog Posts

Posts for the [ioncoin.org Site Blog](https://ioncoin.org/blog) should be
added to the `_posts` directory with the naming convention:
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-ARBITRARY_FILE_NAME` (with month and day as two-digit
numbers). The YAML front matter should be similar to this:

```
---
layout: post
title: New ion Coin Site
permalink: /posts/new-ion-coin-site
author: Mitchell Cash
---
```

The layout parameter should always be as specified above. The other
parameters should be set to values specific to that post.

Below the YAML front matter, enter the content of the post in Markdown
format. Images should be placed in `assets/img/blog/free` if they are
MIT-licensed or `img/blog/nonfree` if they have a more restrictive
copyright license.
