<div class="row" id="proof-of-stake">
    <h5>Proof-of-Stake</h5>
    <p>ion is a blockchain based decentralized cryptocurrency that rewards network participation via static proof of stake by rewarding “connectivity age” instead of “coin age”. By having a static reward system, the rewards for participation are proportional to the work every active node contributes. This discourages centralization and promotes network health. In addition to static rewards, ion implements a masternode network to incentivize large holders, and perform advanced functions such as near instant and private transactions.</p>
    <p>The long term vision for ion is a thriving cryptocurrency ecosystem centered on gaming and digital goods.</p>

<div class="row" id="masternodes">
    <h5>Masternodes</h5>
    <p>Masternodes validate all public transactions within about 4 seconds by communicating each transaction across all nodes on the network to prevent double spending (Duffield, Schinzel, and Gutierrez, 2014). When private transactions are initiated, masternodes also perform the work necessary to make the transactions hard to trace. The masternode network will be able to perform additional functions as new developments are commissioned and the bounties executed.</p>
