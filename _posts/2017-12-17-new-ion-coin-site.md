The ion community is proud to announce ioncoin.org an informational site dedicated to outlining the goals and features of ion, getting new users started with the software and making sure developers have everything they need to start leveraging the power of the ion blockchain within their own apps or to even start contributing to the ion coin code itself.

Although ioncoin.org participates in similar community forums as the [ionomy](https://ionomy.com/) organisation, this site is a community driven and independent open source project and not affiliated with ionomy. Changes to the site are managed publicly through the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ioncoin-dot-org/ioncoin.org).

This is just the beginning of the site and there is still so much content to add. We plan to continue to consolidate and add more documentation and usage tips for both end users and developers alike.

We hope you enjoy the new site and if notice any issues, please donâ€™t hesitate to mention it on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/ioncoin-dot-org/ioncoin.org/issues/new).
